% The "WeatherPy" folders contains all of the scripts and outputs for the Module 6 challenge assignment.

% There are 5 key elements submitted for this assignment: "WeatherPy_Morales.ipynb", "output_data" folder, "VacationPy_Morales.ipynb", "api_keys.py", and ".gitignore"

% "WeatherPy_Morales.ipynb" is a jupyter notebook, which contains a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator.

% The output graphs from "WeatherPy_Morales.ipynb" are located in the "output_data" folder.

% "VacationPy_Morales.ipynb" is a jupyter notebook, which contains a Python script to plan future vacations based on parameters of ideal weather conditions.

% Both "WeatherPy_Morales.ipynb" and "VacationPy_Morales.ipynb" reference data from the OpenWeatherMap API and Geoapify API sources; the API keys are stored in "api_keys.py"

% Lastly, the .gitignore file is used for the privacy of not publishing API keys to GitLab, found in the aforementioned api_keys.py file.
